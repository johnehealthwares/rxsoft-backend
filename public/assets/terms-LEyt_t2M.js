You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify Damorex immediately of any unauthorised use of your account.

		title: "Orders & Payments",

		title: "Prescriptions",
		content: "Prescription-only medicines will only be dispensed upon receipt and verification of a valid prescription issued by a licensed medical practitioner. Damorex pharmacists reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order if the prescription appears invalid, altered, expired or inappropriate for the requested medication. By submitting a prescription, you confirm that it is genuine and has been issued for your own use or for the person named on the prescription. Fraudulent prescription submissions may be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities, including the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria."
	},
	{
		title: "Delivery & Returns",
		content: "Damorex delivers to addresses within Lagos, Ogun and Oyo states. Delivery times are estimates and not guaranteed, though we make every effort to meet the selected delivery window. Risk of loss and title for medicines pass to you upon delivery. For safety and regulatory reasons, Damorex does not accept returns or exchanges on medicines once dispensed and delivered. If you receive a damaged, expired or incorrect product, you must contact us within 24 hours of delivery so we can investigate and arrange a resolution. Damorex reserves the right to refuse delivery to addresses deemed unsafe or inaccessible."

	{
		title: "Limitation of Liability",
		content: "Damorex provides its services on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis. While we strive for accuracy, we do not warrant that product descriptions, pricing or availability are error-free. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Damorex and its affiliates, pharmacists, employees and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use our services. This includes damages for loss of profits, data or goodwill. Damorex total liability for any claim arising from these terms or your use of the service is limited to the amount you paid for the specific order giving rise to the claim."
	},
	{
		title: "Governing Law",
		content: "These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the use of Damorex services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Lagos State, Nigeria. Damorex makes no representation that the services are appropriate or available for use outside Nigeria. Users accessing the platform from outside Nigeria do so at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with local laws."
